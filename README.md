# Employee Management System

## Project Description:
This project is a simple Employee Management System built in C++. It allows users to manage and store information about employees, including worker number, ID, name, and email. The system supports the following key operations:

- **Add a New Worker**: Allows users to enter details of workers and store them in an array.
- **Search for a Worker**: Enables searching for a worker by their worker number.
- **Exit the Program**: The program will terminate upon user command.

This project demonstrates basic **structs**, **arrays**, and **input/output operations** in C++, along with simple user interaction through terminal commands.

## Features:
